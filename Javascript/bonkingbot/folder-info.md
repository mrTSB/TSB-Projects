This is one of my basic discord bots.

Currently, I am making a more complex bot with a currency system and with cleaner embeeds.
This bot is fully functional and has fun miscellaneous commands, and helpful moderation commands.
This bot has a working help command which is not hard programmed and can be used by anybody.
I have removed the bot's token in config.json for security purposes, even though it was old and useless.

I am capeable of making another bot like this, but in python.
